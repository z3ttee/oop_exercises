# Returning references
This programm should be executed with a set of numbers on the command line.
The numbers are read and translated into ``structs``. A function ``search`` looks
for existing values and, on success, increments the ``occurance`` counter. At the
end of the program the whole list is printed out.

#### Additional exercise
Implement a sort function that should be executed in the search function.
The goal is to automatically sort the list if a new element that is appended to 
the list.
